Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree consists of root and leafs. Let each leaf be called node. A node has two pointers, one left and 
another right, and so on . . .
A node consists of a number, left pointer and a right pointer. 

The value to the left of the parent node is lower than that of the parent node.
The value to the right of the parent node is higher than that of the parent node.

There is no tail in a bst
