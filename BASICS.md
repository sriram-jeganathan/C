## Data Types
In order to use a variable, the data type of the variable must be specified along with it's name.
To pass the variable in a printf statement, a format specifier must be used.
There are 4 basic data types along with it's format specifier
1. char - %c or %s 
2. int - %d
3. float - %f
4. double - %lf

**NOTE:** there is no string data type in C

## Arithmetic Operators
The common operators used in C to carry out mathematical calculations are ( with operator precedence )
| Operators | 
|:---------:|
| *         |
| /         |
| %         |
| +         |
| -         |
| ++        |
| --        |

## Logical Operators
These operators are used to specify the logic between variables and operators, with multiple conditions

| Operators |    Use    | 
|:---------:|:---------:|
| && - AND  | Returns true only when both values are true |
 || - OR   | Returns true if any one value is true |
| ! - NOT   | Returns true if false and false if true |
